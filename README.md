### Playing with Redux Middleware

This is a simple redux counter app, set up to use some simple custom middleware.

To get started:  

```
  git clone git@github.com:wvmitchell/playing-with-redux-middleware.git
  npm i
  npm run start
```

The custom middlewares all live in `middlewares.js` under `src/`
